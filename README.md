# Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Network
Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Network is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and learn complex patterns and representations from data, enabling powerful solutions for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.

Here I will share the exercises which I completed in online programs learning like Coursera and other training case studies and exemples.
